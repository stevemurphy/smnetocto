One of the reasons I keep this blog is to keep up with -- and try out -- blogging technology. My earlier post about Flock is an example. <i>This </i>post is a test of a [Firefox extension](http://performancing.com/firefox) from [Performancing](http://performancing.com/), which allows you to blog directly from within Firefox. Very simple, works well, and great for those times when you are surfing and something worth blogging comes to mind.

[Performancing](http://performancing.com/) also offer a blog site statistics tool, which is free and worth checking out.
