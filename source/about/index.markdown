## about the blog ##

This blog started in other forms and other places. In it's first incarnation it was built using Wordpress, but now it uses [Octopress](http://octopress.org). At the moment, the design is simply the default one.

Some references and links are rather old, and may not work. For the most part if something was worth fixing, it has been, so anything left that is broken has been left that way for old-time's sake. Call me sentimental -- or lazy, or a digital hoarder -- your choice.
